# True-Trip

This app calculates and displays the "true cost of driving".  There are many hidden costs to driving such as depreciation, insurance, fuel, etc.  This makes it difficult for drivers to know how much it costs to take a trip.  This app helps shed some light on the cost of driving by integrating data from the Edmunds API, and calculating costs for an individual trip.
