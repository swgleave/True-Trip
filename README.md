# True-Trip

This app calculates and displays the "true cost of driving".  There are many hidden costs to driving such as depreciation, insurance, fuel, etc.  This makes it difficult for drivers to know how much it costs to take a trip.  This app helps shed some light on the cost of driving by integrating data from the Edmunds API, and calculating costs for an individual trip.  Trip distances are calculated using the Google Maps API.

After building the initial prototype for this application, I began to throw this onto a website for others to use.  While I was in the process of building the application, Edmunds changed their API data policy, restricting to allow use of their data by only several partners.
